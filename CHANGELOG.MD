## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.0.0 to 1.0.1

#### Breaking Change(s)
- `baseURL` configuration option has been removed

#### Migration Steps

**Before (1.0.0):**
```typescript
const client = new OsintCat({
    apiKey: 'your-key',
    baseURL: 'https://www.osintcat.net',
    customHeaders: {} // Optional
});
```

**After (1.0.1):**
```typescript
const client = new OsintCat({
    apiKey: 'your-key',
    timeout: 90000, // Optional: defaults to 90 seconds
    customHeaders: {} // Optional
});
```

If you relied on custom baseURL (for whatever reason...), you'll need to implement that at the application level.

#### New Features to Adopt
- All methods now validate input and throw descriptive errors
- Enhanced TypeScript types for better IDE autocomplete
- Improved error messages with `OsintCatError` class
